# MindApp: A Java Swing Mind Mapping Tool

MindApp is a mind mapping tool developed with Java Swing, providing an intuitive interface for creating and managing complex mind maps. It leverages Java AWT and Swing components for rendering and allows users to interact with the mind map nodes through a graphical interface. Users can add, edit, delete nodes, and export the mind map to PNG or XML formats.

## Features

- **Interactive Mind Map Creation**: Easily add and arrange nodes with drag-and-drop.
- **Node Editing**: Double-click on any node to edit its text.
- **Add Child Nodes**: Right-click on a node to add child nodes, facilitating the creation of complex hierarchical structures.
- **Customize Node Color**: Personalize your mind map by changing the node colors.
- **Export Options**: Export your mind map to PNG for image format or XML for data preservation.
